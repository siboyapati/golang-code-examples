The best way to learn is by example.  

This is a collection of Go code examples that demonstrate various concepts.

Read the companion articles at the [Golang Code Examples web site] (http://l3x.github.io/golang-code-examples/).

These examples could be useful for your projects, thesis and learning.

Feel free to use any of the code examples in your endeavors.

I hope this ressource is helpful to you.
